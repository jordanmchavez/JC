2d game, retro/limited art style
alternating isolation and danger with safety and community

settlement, caravans to gather resources, come back and build up

or "mobile base" only, you help build them up
one of the few who braves the wilderness
long periods of time between settlements where you're in perpetual danger

haven game..run an inn/place to protect people on the border
settlement / hunt / fight
realtime vs turn-based

survival, settlement building, primitive, defense
trader, caravan, merc company, mobile base

difficult to mix caravans + settlement, because if you're focusing on one then you're not focusing on the other

another option is to pick an existing game and simply build an engine that lets you replicate it

runewars/twilight imperium turn-based 4x
Banished/Clanfolk/Rimworld/Dawn of Man pure colony survival sim
Vagrus/Rogue Trader/Pirates caravan/trading sim, mobile base, build up your crew
MoM city-based 4x
Eador combat-focused 4x
X-COM/KDM where the fight is the focus and the settlement is just prep for the next fight

Trading sim in a KDM-like world

You have a caravan in a plane of almost total darkness
navigation would be a problem
food and maintenance would be a problem
morale would be a problem
monsters would be a problem

an alternative is a day/night cycle where the nights are very dangerous
the days/nights could also be longer, so camping means something, for example 1 week of day followed by 1 week of night where you have to hunker down
1 week regular, 1 week pure darkness where you're basically defending against monsters

two modes: camp mode, travel mode
camp mode means you can heal, repair, forage

robust combat interface

start in a Region
Region has various Locations
you can Explore a region to find Locations with your Scouts
Regions may have Monsters that you can Hunt with your Fighters/Party
Hunts have a series of Events based on the Quarry
Hunts are essential to survival because they're the main way of getting Resources
Regions can have Settlements where you can Interact in various ways: trade, raid, defend, assist, buildup, diplomacy, factions

Resources
	Food
	Materials
	Weapons, Armor, Relics
	Survivors
		Fighters
		Scouts
		Workers

You can Camp in any Region and lay down temporary Structures to do various tasks: craft, heal, etc

KDM unlocks higher-level items by getting materials from higher-level quarries or other means (pop size, time, etc)
definitely experience, skills and such for survivors
